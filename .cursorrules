# John_Holmes Project Directives

## Persistent Sessions
- **Do NOT close the browser** if a successful login has been performed on Fastweb, unless explicitly requested with a `force` flag or during production cleanup.
- During development and testing iterations, prioritize maintaining the open browser context to avoid the overhead of re-logging in.
- Check the `session_state.json` file or the internal `isLoggedIn` property before calling `browser.close()`.

## API Design
- Keep endpoints simple and modular.
- Use `src/browserManager.js` as the singleton for all browser interactions.

## Documentation
- **Update documentation for EVERY modification**: Ensure that `README.md`, `walkthrough.md`, and any relevant artifacts are updated whenever a change is made to the codebase or project structure.
- Maintain a clear and chronological record of changes in the `walkthrough.md`.

## Project Hygiene
- **Continuous Cleanup**: After every modification, audit the project and remove any useless or redundant files, code, or dependencies.
- Keep the project structure lean and focused on the core functionality.

## Knowledge Base
- **Use README.md as the primary Knowledge Base**: Always refer to and update the `README.md` as the source of truth for the project's architecture, API, and technical decisions.
- Ensure the `README.md` is kept up-to-date with any changes in logic or configuration.
